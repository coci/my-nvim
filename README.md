Adding new plugins to this configuration is straightforward. Simply create a new Lua file for the plugin under the `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins` directory.

1. Navigate to the plugins folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins
   ```
2. Create a new file for your plugin:
   ```bash
   touch {plugin-name}.lua
   ```
3. Add the plugin configuration inside this file. For example:
   ```lua
   return {
       "author/plugin-name",
       config = function()
           -- Plugin-specific configuration here
       end
   }
   ```

The `lazy` package manager will automatically detect and load the new plugin.
